# Roadmap — agent-replay

## v0.2 (Planned)

### 🔗 LangChain / LlamaIndex Integration
Native callbacks and hooks for LangChain and LlamaIndex so agent traces are captured automatically without manual instrumentation.

### ▶️ Streaming Replay
Replay agent traces step-by-step in the terminal with configurable playback speed — great for demos, debugging, and onboarding.

### 🔀 Trace Comparison UI
Side-by-side diff view to compare two agent runs, highlighting where decisions diverged. Useful for regression testing prompt changes.

### 📤 OpenTelemetry Export
Export traces in OpenTelemetry format for integration with Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, or any OTEL-compatible backend.
